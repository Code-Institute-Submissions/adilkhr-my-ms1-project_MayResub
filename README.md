A future feature that i would like to add to my website would be a login portal for members so that they can see for example their stats on their gym usage for the week aswell as them being able to log in their progress and make a sort of timetable that suits them

## Wireframes

Wireframes have been created for all three pages and have been designed for desktop, tablet and phones. Wireframes can be viewed through the wireframes folder

## Typography and color scheme

* For Typography i used google fonts and used the font familys of russo one and robboto with the russo one font being the main font family used across the site as its font that i felt stands out alot
* The color scheme used throughout the page were mainly white, black and a royal dark blue as i felt there was no need to overcomplicate the site with too many colors otherwise it wouldnt look visually appealing, i used the hex values of #fff for an offwhite color and #001684 for a nice dark royal blue shade across the page

## Technonology

* The Languages used to code my project were HTML and CSS as i used HTML to build the content of the site and then used CSS to then style the HTML content to make it look visually appealing for users
* I used Google fonts and fontawesome icon links in my pages to add specific font styles aswell as icons to my page to make it look appealing and not dull and boring
* I used bootstrap version 4.6 to create sections of the pages so that it would be resonsive for all screens  
* I used github and gitpod to code the site aswell as deploying the github pages live so that the site is active and live for anyone to use

## Testing

### Supported screens and browsers:

After using bootstrap to build my pages and the use of CSS media queries styles, my site is supported for all screens with a width of 280px and above and is supported for all browsers

### Test cases:

### Code validation:

I had used the w3schools validator tool to see if there was any issues with my HTML and CSS codes, (https://validator.w3.org/)

* When inputing my index.html code through w3schools validator i had noticed there was erros with the images used for the gyms aims section as they did not have alt attributes, after adding the alt attributes there is no erros with the index html code
* When inputing gallery.html code through w3schools validator there was no errors
* When inputing signup.html code through w3schools validator i had a 2 major problems, i had a typo error with the for attributes for the label tags and i had also had the name attributes empty for the input tags in the sign up form, after resolving that issue, there is no erros with the signup html code 
* When inputing CSS coding through w3schools validator there was no erros

### Fixed bugs:

* Resolved the alt attribute issue for the gallery.html by adding an alt attribute to each src element
* Resolved the CSS errors by adjusting the typo erros 
* Resolved the issue by deleting the for attributes inside the input elements

## Deployment

The deployment process of my project was simple, when creating my html pages through gitpod i had made sure that i had added the file and then git commit it with a message then done a git push, once that was done i ensured that i had deployed the github pages by going on the github pages section and changing the source branch to master so that the site would be live and published giving me the live sight URL. I had ensured that git commit adds and git commit messages were done regurlaly and nessecary with relevant comments and then pushed out with the git push comand through git pod
