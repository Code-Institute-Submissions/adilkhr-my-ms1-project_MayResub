## Features

### Navigation Bar:

The navigation bar will be vibrant and easy to use with the name of ADZ fitness with a home, sign-up and gallery button which users will be able to click to navigate from page to page. On smaller devices I have used a dropdown button to display the menu to make it fully responsive.

### Footer:

The footer will contain social media links for users to browse and connect with the gym. The footer will have an about us section, displays opening hours and contact information for the gym. The footer matches the vibrant design of the navigation bar.

### Home:

Home page includes details about the gym's goals and aims for members and new users. It showcases a bold hero image. It will display the gyms training schedules for the week. I have also included 3 image cards that feature - Get Strong, Get Healthy, Get Social. On smaller devices they are stacked and on larger devices they are spread horizontally.

### Sign up page:

Sign up page includes a sign-up form for new members to fill in their details so that they will be contacted with an induction date.

### Gallery Page:

The Gallery page displays the follwing images:

* The gym and its facilites
* Photos of gym members working out

I have used a bootstrap carousel to display the images.

## Future Features 

A future feature that I would like to add to my website would be a login portal. This would enable the members to track their stats, see their progress and make a timetable that suits them.

## Typography and color scheme

* For Typography I used google fonts and used the font familys of Russo one and Roboto with the Russo one font being the main font family used across the site as it stands out.
* The colour scheme used throughout the page were mainly white, black and a royal dark blue. I kept the colour theme to a minimum as i felt there was no need to overcomplicate the site as it may distract users from the content and would not look visually appealing. I used the hex values of #fff for an off-white colour and ##001684 for a nice dark royal blue shade across the page.

***

## Technonologies Used

* The Languages used to code my project were HTML5 to create the Mark-up language using sematic structure, and CCS3 for the Cascading style sheet used to style the content look visually appealing
* I used Google fonts and fontawesome icon links in my pages to add specific font styles aswell as icons to my page to make it look appealing and not dull and boring
* I used bootstrap version 4.6 to create sections of the pages so that it would be resonsive for all screens  
* I used Github to host the repository and Gitpod.io to write the code, and using the command line for committing and pushing the code to Github
* I used GIT for version control of the project
* I used Balsamiq wireframes to create wireframes for my site
* I used Paint to design the hero image of the home page

## Testing

### Supported screens:

After using bootstrap to build my pages and the use of CSS media queries styles, using the google inspect tool i was able to see that my site is supported for all screens with a width of 280px. I also did some testing by sending my website link to my friends and familys devices and they had seen no issues.

### Supported browsers: 

The website link has been tested on Google chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft edge, Brave and Firefox.

### OS compatibility:

Tested on iOS, Android 10, and Windows 10. - I asked a friend with an Adroid to test that it was working.
Tested for responsiveness using Chrome DevTools.

### Peformance Testing

Tested on the Developer Tools Lighthouse. This was the first time running through Lighthouse.


### Testing User Stories:

* #### A first user looking to sign up to the gym
The user can fill in the sign up form that has been created on the sign up page.
* #### A user looking to navigate the site and switch to other pages aswell as being able to use the site on other devices
The user can naviagate from page to page (Home, Gallery and Signup) with the responsive navbar and can navigate the page without any issue as the site for all pages and sections are responsive.
* #### A user wanting to know what training session the gym runs during the week
The user can see the gym's training sessions that are run during the week on the home page as it is layed out in a table.
* #### A user want to know the location of the gym and the opening hours
The user can see the gym's opening hours for all the days in the week on the footer for all pages.
* #### A user wanting to see images of the gym's facilities and other images related to the gym
The user can view images of the gym's facilites and member images working out on the gallery page.
* #### A user being able to acess the gym's contact information if they have any queries
The user can access the gym's contact information (address, email, phone, Fax) on the footer for all pages.
* #### A user wanting to connect to the gym's social media accounts
The user can click on the social media icons which are linked to their respective social media pages through the footer section.

### Code validation:

I had used the w3schools validator tool to see if there was any issues with my HTML and CSS codes, (https://validator.w3.org/).

* When inputing my index.html code through w3schools validator I had noticed there was erros with the images used for the gym's aims section as they did not have alt attributes, after adding the alt attributes there is no erros with the index html code.
* When inputing gallery.html code through w3schools validator there was no errors.
* When inputing signup.html code through w3schools validator I had a 2 major problems, I had a typo error with the for attributes for the label tags and I had also had the name attributes empty for the input tags in the sign up form, after resolving that issue, there is no erros with the signup html code. 
* When inputing CSS coding through w3schools validator there was no erros.

### Fixed bugs:

* An issue I was having with my home page was that I found that the gym trainning schedule table was not responsive for the galaxy fold screen which has a 280px screen width causing some horizontal scrolling to occur, I had fixed this issue by adding a media query to reduce the font size when viewed on smaller screen sizes.

The deployment process of my project was done using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository of the project currently working on.

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. The page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
