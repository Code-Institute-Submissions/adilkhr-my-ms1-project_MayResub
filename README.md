A future feature that i would like to add to my website would be a login portal for members so that they can see for example their stats on their gym usage for the week aswell as them bwing able to log in their progress and make a sort of timetable that suits them

## Wireframes

Wireframes have been created for all three pages and have been designed for desktop, tablet and phones. Wireframes can be viewed through the wireframes folder

## Typography and color scheme

* For Typography i used google fonts and used the font familys of russo one and robboto with the russo one font being the main font family used across the site as its font that i felt stands out alot
* The color scheme used throughout the page were mainly white, black and a royal dark blue as i felt there was no need to overcomplicate the site with too many colors otherwise it wouldnt look visually appealing, i used the hex values of #fff for an offwhite color and #001684 for a nice dark royal blue shade across the page

## Technonology

* The Languages used to code my project were HTML and CSS as i used HTML to build the content of the site and then used CSS to then style the HTML content to make it look visually appealing for users
* I used Google fonts and fontawesome icon links in my pages to add specific font styles aswell as icons to my page to make it look appealing and not dull and boring
* I used bootstrap version 4.6 to create sections of the pages so that it would be resonsive for all screens  
* I used github and gitpod to code the site aswell as deploying the github pages live so that the site is active and live for anyone to use

## Testing

### Supported screens and browsers:

My pages seem to be responsive when testing on the following devices: Desktop, Pixel 2, Pixel 2xl, Iphone 6/7/8, Iphone 6/7/8 plus, Iphone x, Ipad, Ipad pro and Surface duo

### Test cases:

### Code validation:

* When inputing gallery.html code through w3schools validator i had an error for my src elements as i needed to add an alt attribute to them
* When inputing CSS coding through w3schools validator i had 2 small errors in my coding due to typo errors
